# Multiprogramming-Operating-System-MOS-
# Operation System concepts

# OS Phase -1: 
Used (SI) to demonstrate Read ,Write & Terminate operations and
CPU/ Machine Simulation, Supervisor Calls through interrupt.

# OS Phase -2:
Used System interrupts (SI) , Programme interrupts (PI) , Timer
Interrupts (TI) with their combinations on Page fault, Operand error , OpCode
error with Total Time & Line Limit(TTL) & (TLL). to demonstrate Read ,Write &
Terminate operations to input-output to the file. Paging, Error Handling ,
Interrupt, Generation & Servicing, PCB Data Structure 

# Tech Stack : C++ & Data Structures
